Aim : To detect the fake review in given dataset and remove them.

Problem Statement : The widespread use of online reviews has made it easier for people to make informed decisions about purchasing products. However, the fake reviews regarding the product has made it difficult for consumers to trust online reviews. The problem at hand is to develop a fake review detection and removal system that should be able to accurately identify the fake reviews by analyzing the sentiment of the review and then removing the fake review. The key issue with the fake review detection system is the accuracy of model used in previously developed systems. The goal here is to use different combinations of sentiment analysis techniques to increase the accuracy of existing systems.
